spparks-demo
============

`spparks-demo` is a tutorial for getting started with using [`SPPARKS`](http://spparks.sandia.gov) for microstructural science.
SPPARKS is an open source Unix-style command line application developed at [SANDIA National Labs](http://www.sandia.gov) for mesoscale materials modeling. 

This demo is a part of the [2014 Materials Science workshop on methods for 3D microstuctural studies](http://www.materials.cmu.edu/news/summerworkshop.html) at Carnegie Mellon University.
The demo briefly covers the design and capabilities of SPPARKS, and focuses on how to use SPPARKS for simulating grain growth in polycrystalline materials.
This includes compiling SPPARKS from the source code, writing and running simulation scripts, grain growth kinetics, and visualizing simulation data with [pizza.py](http://pizza.sandia.gov) and [ParaView](http://www.paraview.org).
